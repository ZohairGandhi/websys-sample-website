        <p>This is some stuff that's been on my mind:</p>

          <li>Do Tim Tams taste better refrigerated? (Yes)</li>

          <li>Does hot sauce need to be refrigerated?</li>

          <li>Will I ever be able to buy eggs again?</li>

        </p>

        <table>
          <tr id="head-row">
            <th>Day</th>
            <th>Hours of Productive Work</th>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Monday</td>
            <td>Absolutely none</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Tuesday</td>
            <td>Absolutely none</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>
            <td>Wednesday</td>
            <td>Absolutely none</td>
          </tr>

          <tr>

            <td>7 minutes</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
